# rutorrent-filemanager
rTorrent file management plugin for ruTorrent webUI running with shell/javascript/php

Javascript web client with php endpoint with file operations methods

#### Features:
- support for file operations: copy/move/delete/rename
- hotkeys for copy/move actions (ctrl/cmd-c/x/v)
- integrated operations in torrent Files tab
- using twigjs for views
- sfv checksum functionality 
- text/nfo viewer, with configurable text extensions 
- archive unpack functionality, with configurable file extensions

#### Configuration
Currently the plugin supports handling archive files with 7zip and rar (non free). 
All archive manipulation is done with the use of 7zip, while rar is used ONLY for creation.
 
The paths for each archive util can be configured by changing with a value suited for your linux distribution:
```php
// sample config for debian based
$pathToExternals['rar'] = '';
$pathToExternals['7zip'] = '/usr/bin/7z';
```
For a hint on how to add support for rar [see this](https://github.com/nelu/rutorrent-dock/blob/5357bd94bfc026ff0a6645501487ac140d7a92fe/src/build/Dockerfile#L48)

Since all extraction is handled by 7zip, you can specify which file extensions are available for extraction using a regex syntax:
```php
// see what 7zip extraction supports as type by file extension
$config['fileExtractExtensions'] = '7z|bzip2|t?bz2|t?g|gz[ip]?|iso|img|lzma|rar|tar|t?xz|zip|z01|wim';
```
See what archive formats your 7zip supports with: `7z i`

Configuration for creating different archive formats is done by specifing each archive extension with its configuration:
```php
// archive type extension and binary for new archive
$config['archive']['type'] = [
    '7z' => [
        'bin' =>'7zip',
        'compression' => [0, 5, 9],
    ],
    'rar' => [
        'bin' =>'rar',
        'compression' => range(0, 5),
    ]];

// using 7z for zip file creation
$config['archive']['type']['zip'] = $config['archive']['type']['7z'];
```
In the example above we are adding `.zip` archive support (as extension) by using the same config as for `.7z`

The `'bin'` value must a be a valid `$pathToExternals` key, ex: 
```php
$pathToExternals['7zip']
...
        'bin' =>'7zip',
```

TODO:
- use 7zip for file checksum operations (multiple hashing algorithms): replace native php sfv hasher and implement more algos
